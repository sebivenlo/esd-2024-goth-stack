## Welcome to Go, Templ and Htmx!

This workshop project supports live reload with Air. You can just run
```sh
air
```
to run the project and have it hot reload on every change.  
**Open [`localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080) and see the website!**

## Exercises
### Exercise 1
First, let us get more comfortable with Templ (and Go). You can see we have an Index page already under `views/index.templ`. Take a look at that. After that, have a look at how Go serves this page in `main.go`.  
**Analogous to that, can you create a simple `/about` page?**
