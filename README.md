# GOTH Stack Workshop ðŸš€
Welcome to the **ESD-2024-GOTH-Stack** workshop repository! It contains everything you need to follow along with the workshop, including assignments, documentation, and examples. 
This workshop demonstrates how to build a web application using the **GOTH stack**:
- [**Go**](https://github.com/sebivenlo/esd-2024-goth-stack/blob/main/Documentation/Golang.md) â€“ a fast, statically typed, compiled programming language
- [**T**empl](https://github.com/sebivenlo/esd-2024-goth-stack/blob/main/Documentation/Templ.md) â€“ a template-based code generator for Go, simplifying your HTML generation
- [**H**TMX](https://github.com/sebivenlo/esd-2024-goth-stack/blob/main/Documentation/HTMX.md) â€“ a lightweight JavaScript library for extending HTML with dynamic, server-driven functionality

Check out our [wiki](https://github.com/sebivenlo/esd-2024-goth-stack/wiki) for more in depth explanations and further resources on the different components of this stack.

## Overview

During this workshop, youâ€™ll learn how to:
- Build server-side logic in Go.
- Use Templ for generating static HTML components (or other Go boilerplate).
- Enhance your web pages with dynamic interactions using HTMX.

By the end, youâ€™ll have a solid starting point for creating **modern, server-driven web applications** without the complexity of heavy frontend frameworks.
